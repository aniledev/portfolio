      <p>I'm a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> learning software engineering. Currently, Florida is where I call home. </p>
      <p>As an aspiring software developer, my focus lies in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>writing code that's easy to read, easy to maintain, and most importantly, easy to use</li>
        <li>learning a wide range of programming tools, technologies, languages, and frameworks</li>
        <li>collaborating with others we can produce better and grow faster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Outside of software development, my interests are many and varied. In my free time I enjoy:</p>
      <div>
      <ul>
        <li>weightlifting</lil>
        <li>fiction writing and binge reading</lil>
        <li>learning languages (the regular kind, not the programming kind)</lil>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p>I'm glad you're here. Take a look around and feel free to contact me!</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Like many millennials, I graduated with a "respectable" degree: international relations. After graduation, it dawned on me that my passions had shifted.</p>
      <p>I pursued a career in social media and mixed media. During this time, I gained relevant skills in digital marketing, SEO, radio broadcasting, and mixed media publications.</p>
      <p>My journey to becoming a software developer started with wondering how all the tools and technologies I used as a marketer <strong><em>really</em></strong> worked.</p>
      <p>I'm currently a full-time student in Thinkful's <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/full-time/#curriculum">Engineering Immersion</a> track. The journey has only just begun!</p>
